        <p><i>Some interesting facts about Cicada's!</i></p> 

        <ul>

        <li>There are about 3,000 known species of cicadas worldwide.</li>
        <li>Annual cicadas emerge every year, while periodic cicadas emerge every 13 to 17 years.</li>
        <li>Periodic cicadas use a method called predator satiation to ensure their survival. Since they all emerge at once and in such large numbers all the predators become sated (full) and remaining cicadas can mate without interruption.</li>
